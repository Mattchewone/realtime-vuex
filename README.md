# realtime

> This project uses Channels to filter realtime data by a usersId. Signup in two different windows/browsers with different names. Type the name for the user you wish to send a message to, and the message will appear in your list as you sent it, and it will appear in the other users window. Create a third user so you can see that the third user will not receive realtime events.

## About
